			<p><strong>01/04/2389 Daily News Feed: Prime Minister announces potential cure</strong></p> 
			<p> The Prime Minister today announced a potential cure, nicknamed 'H.O.P.E', to the current health crisis.</p>
			<p> Following an unforeseen error in current medical nano-technology, millions of people worldwide are dying from diseases not seen for centuries.</p>
			<p> Leading Immunologists are claiming that human immune systems have regressed due to centuries of using medical technology as a 'vital, but flawed, crutch'.<p>

			<p>H.O.P.E will see newly trained 'Technicians' inserting stem cells into sick patients.</p>
			<p>These technicians will then use the stem cell to 'grow' that patient a new immune system, to combat infections.</p>
			<p>Stem cells are used due to their unique ability to divide into any other type of human cell</p>
			<p>The Prime Minister said "These brave individauls who have volunteered are almost finished training. It will be soon be up to them to help save our race from this microscope threat"</p>

			<p>H.O.P.E is short for <strong>H</strong>uman <strong>O</strong>ptimised <strong>P</strong>luripotent stem cell <strong>E</strong>ngineering.</p>

			<h2>>Welcome Technician.</h2>
			<p>This online resource is designed to remind you of the critical rules of operation before you operate on your first patient.</p>
			<h3>>Rule 1: Your stem cells die, you die. </h3>
			<p>Stem cells are your most important assets. Use them to create all other units and structures. There are 3 types, listed below in descending importance</p>
			<p class='unit-header'>Type 1: <strong>Totipotent</strong> (literal translation- 'entire power')</p> 
			<p>This is the first cell you insert in a patient, and from this you grow your base of operations.<p>
			<div class='unit-image'>
			<img src='assets/images/stem-cell.png' style="height: 150px; width: 150px;">
			</div>
			<div class='unit-text'>
    		<p>Primary Ability:</p> 
    		<p>Can create any other type of cell. Cannot be replaced.</p>
			</div>
			<div style="clear:both"></div>
			<p class='unit-header'>Type 2: <strong>Pluripotent</strong> (literal translation- 'many power')</p> 
			<p>This cell creates structures.<p>
			<div class='unit-image'>
			<img src='assets/images/pluripotent.png' style="height: 150px; width: 150px;">
			</div>
			<div class='unit-text'>
    		<p>Primary Ability:</p> 
    		<p>Can create any structure cell. More can be produced using the totipotent stem cell.</p>
			</div>
			<div style="clear:both"></div>
		</div>
		<h3>Rule 2: create secondary stem cells first </h3>
		<div class='terminal'>
			<p>After base initilisation, the next objective is to produce units and structures. Units are produced from the Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). <p>
			<p> Units are white blood cells. These will protect your base and can be used in both attack and defence. These include Neutrophils, Monocytes, B Cells and T Cells</p>
			<p> Please note: pronounciation course 02-Alpha is available to help Technicians pronounce technical terms correctly</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Rule 3: Structures help you gather nutrients, defend and maintain your base</h3>
		<div class='terminal'>
			<p>Pluripotent stem cells (literal translation- 'many power') can create your base structures. You will need these to create strong bases.</p>
			<p>Structures are defensive, such as skin, mucus and stomach cells. They can also provide you with abilities, such as the spleen cells.</p>
