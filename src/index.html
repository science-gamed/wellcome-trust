					<p>A group of leading nanotechnologists has warned that the court battle over the Omnicure patents could result in a catastrophe of 'biblical' proportions if Trolltech, which acquired the patents last year, makes good on its threat to shut down the Omnicure system if it loses the case.</p>

					<p>But a spokesman for the chief prosecutor said that the United Earth Government 'does not negotiate with terrorists'...</p>

			<h2>Welcome, trainee.</h2>
			<p>You have been selected to join the first cadre of H.O.P.E. technicians. Congratulations. Humanity's future is in your hands.</p>

			<p>This manual will familiarise you with the critical rules of operation before training commences.</p>
			
			

			<h3>Rule 1: Your stem cells die, your patient dies.</h3>
			<p>Your job is to rebuild the patient's immune system and train it to attack pathogens. To do so, you must create a variety of cellular structures from the patient's stem cells. If those stem cells are destroyed, death is guaranteed.</p>

			<p>There are two types of stem cell:</p>

			<div class='unit' style='background-image:url(assets/images/t-stemcell.png);'>
				<h4>Totipotent stem cells</h4> 
				
				<p>Your starting point. The totipotent (which means 'has total power' in Latin) stem cell can differentiate into any other type of cell.</p>

				<p>The H.O.P.E. procedure begins with 'capturing' a totipotent stem cell so that you can control it via your interface. The cell must be protected at all costs.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class='unit' style='background-image:url(assets/images/p-stemcell.png);'>
				<h4>Pluripotent stem cells</h4> 
				
				<p>As a technician, you will spend much of your time controlling pluripotent ('has many powers' in Latin) stem cells, which can differentiate into the cells required by the body to fight pathogens &ndash; both directly (the immune system, in the form of white blood cells), and indirectly in the form of defensive structures and transport systems.</p>
			</div>


			<aside>
				<div class='aside-content typewriter' style='top: -100px;'>
					<p><strong>22/04/2389</strong></p>

					<p>Martial law has been declared in zones 7-12, as the death toll following the Omnicure shutdown rose into the millions.</p>

					<p>In a holographic address, Earth President Kobayashi urged citizens to stay indoors, saying her administration was pursuing 'every avenue'...</p>
				</div>
			</aside>


			<h3>Rule 2: Do not underestimate your adversary.</h3>

			<p>Your enemies &ndash; bacteria, viruses, and parasites &ndash; are small. Do not be fooled. They are the original weapons of mass destruction, evolved over hundreds of millions of years.</p>

			<p>Though they come in many forms, they share some basic characteristics:</p>

			<div class='unit' style='background-image:url(assets/images/bacteria.png);'>
				<h4>Bacteria</h4> 
				
				<p>Scientists have found bacteria in acidic hot springs, in radioactive waste, at the bottom of the deep ocean, and in the hydrocarbon lakes of Titan. Compared to these environments, your patient's body is a luxury holiday resort in the Caribbean.</p>

				<p>Bacteria will release toxins, damaging nearby cells.</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class='unit' style='background-image:url(assets/images/virus.png);'>
				<h4>Viruses</h4>

				<p>The origin of viruses is unclear. It's also unclear whether they should be considered alive &ndash; while they can reproduce and evolve, they lack other characteristics commonly regarded as essential qualities for living organisms.</p>

				<p>Alive or not, they are certainly deadly. Viruses will infect host cells, and create copies of themselves, destroying the cell in the process.</p>
			</div>

			<div class='unit' style='background-image:url(assets/images/stem-cell.png);'>
				<h4>Parasites</h4> 
				
				<p>Parasites are some of nature's most creative killers. They have been known to control the minds of their hosts, causing themselves to commit suicide in a way that advances the parasite's lifecycle. Others &ndash; from tapeworms to malaria &ndash; vary in deadliness.</p>

				<p>Many of the parasites you will encounter weaken your patients' defences by 'stealing' nutrients.</p>
			</div>


			<aside>
				<div class='aside-content typewriter' style='top: -100px;'>
					<p><strong>04/05/2389</strong></p>

					<p>Trials have begun of a therapy which biologists claim could save the lives of people affected by the Omnicure disaster. Human Optimised Pluripotent stem cell Engineering, or H.O.P.E., works by rebuilding the human immune system.</p>

					<p>'Our bodies used to be experts at fighting the very diseases that are now threatening to wipe us out', explained Professor Luke O'Cyte, who led the H.O.P.E. research.</p>

					<p>'The immune system was left withered and dormant by the advent of Omnicure &ndash; now, we must reawaken it if our race is to survive.'</p>
				</div>
			</aside>


			<h3>Rule 3: Time is not on your side.</h3>

			<p>Your mission is simple, but your task is complex. Using H.O.P.E. technology you will be operating at a cellular level on your patients. You must gather resources, create defensive structures, and raise an army of white blood cells trained to seek out and destroy pathogens.</p>

			<p>The human body is the battlefield, and you are the general. Your enemies will not stand still &ndash; they will spread, reproduce and evolve. You cannot afford to lose the tactical advantage.</p>
